    "text": "#Hurricane Milton was a very unusually hurricane in the path it took throughout the Gulf of Mexico, #through Florida, and then through the Atlantic when compared to other hurricanes during 2024, #with hurricane Helene also being an odd hurricane in the path it took through the continental United States as well. #Because of the abnormalities of Milton, I intend to analyze the track of Hurricane Milton through the Gulf of Mexico in comparison to other hurricanes and tropical storm that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, #and via the storm tracks and storm events such as rain and wind measurements of hurricanes from the past 20+ years. #In order of doing this, I will be referring to different hurricane records taken from NOAA’s Historical Hurricanes and Tropical systems webpage, #the CRAN Hurricane Exposure package and NOAA’s Historical Hurricane Tracks webpage, along with the in class lab’s data set #from NOAA’s international-best-track-archive-for-climate-stewardship-ibtracs, #as one of the beast means of analysis for the possible changes in strength of hurricane Milton when compared to these other hurricanes. #With this, I will also be referring to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2022 Sixth Assessment Report to make assessments of the possible strength future hurricanes and tropical storms may have, #based on projections about climate change that are listed within the report."
